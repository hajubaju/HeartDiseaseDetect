Heart Disease Prediction and Gemini Chatbot Web Application
This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided health data. It utilizes a pre-trained Logistic Regression model and integrates with the Gemini API to provide additional information and answer user queries related to heart health and the prediction results.

Features
Heart Disease Prediction: Input your health metrics and get a prediction on the likelihood of having heart disease.
Gemini Chatbot Integration: Interact with a Gemini-powered chatbot to ask questions about heart health, the prediction process, or potential risks.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple web interface for easy data input and result visualization.
Technologies Used
Flask: Python web framework for building the application.
Scikit-learn: For the trained Logistic Regression model and data preprocessing (StandardScaler).
Pandas: For data handling and manipulation.
Google Gemini API: For the conversational chatbot functionality.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For the front-end web interface.
